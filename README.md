# 🔎 Tracker - The Web Beacon API Demo

The `Beacon API` schedules an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server. There are a few specialties of the beacon request,

- Beacon requests typically do not require a response. This is a huge difference from the regular XHR or fetch requests where the client(browser) expects a response from the server.
- Beacon requests are guaranteed to be initiated before a page is unloaded, even when you close the browser.
- Beacon requests run to completion without requiring a blocking request (for example XMLHttpRequest).
- Beacon requests use the HTTP POST method.

This demo logs the time a user spent on the app with a simple message.
